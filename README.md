## <a id="features">Features</a>

- Dynamic header menu that adjusts to user's hardware: 
  - Mobile users will see a header with a side menu button.
  - Desktop users will see a header without a side menu button, but with a navigation button that has a dropdown function.
  - When the desktop screen is wide, the navigation button is replaced with the items displayed directly in the header
- The content of the page has a swiper carousel made with swiper.js
